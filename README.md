# capstone_QuickTask
QuickTask is an efficient and user friendly task management system to help encourage proper work flow. This project will be built utilizing Java and Javascript and will have a database portion that is incorporated into it. Our main desire with this project is to assign a task to a specific employee and allow management the ability to monitor work efficiency and due dates of certain projects. There will be an option within each task to attach an employee and due date to it. Each employee should have the ability to view current and past tasks.

## INSTALLATION 
Our group will be utilzing java and javascript to create our project. The dependencies we decided upon are Postgres, Node.js, Express, and Angular. Postgres will be our database allowing us to store and manage data. Node.js is the runtime environment we are using allowing us to create a server side web application. We are using Express as our node.js framework, Express will help manage our routes for things like tasks and employees. We will use Angular to build the user interface, it will help with the structure of our application.
